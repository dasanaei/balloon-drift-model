# Balloon-Drift-Model
Consisting of three drift simulations, Purdue Orbital's Balloon Drift Model allows the user to visualize the travel of a zero-pressure polyethylene balloon.

### Balloon-Drift-1:
- Uses ground sounding data from the University of Wyoming Department of Atmospheric Science (http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html)
- Contains highly accurate past atmospheric data and a forcast range of one day.
- Best used for research and preliminary testing
- Instructions for use and documentation are located inside of the `\BalloonDrift1\Documentation` directory

### Balloon-Drift-2:
- Uses historical weather data from NASA's open source Earthgram 2016 (not in repo) 
- Allows user to visualize a simulation of the travel of the balloon under average monthly conditions. 
- Best use for modeling flights far enough into the future where no forcast exists.
- Instructions for use and documentation are located inside of the `\BalloonDrift2\Documentation` directory

### Balloon-Drift-3:
- Uses forcasted NOAA weather data 
- Utilzyses highly accurate forcasted weather data for up to 14 days in advance.
- Best used for week of launch preperations. 
- Instructions for use and documentation are located inside of the `\BalloonDrift3\Documentation` directory
